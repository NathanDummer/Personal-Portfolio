            The goal was an app that the IT team could use to share files and delete users in a secure and simple manner. 
            We also used it to migrate from another file sharing service to save around $4,000 a month.
            I used Selenium in Python to run the automation. I also used React within Flask for the front-end portion. The biggest challenge for this project was coming up with creative
            solutions for dealing with unpredictable web elements. There was also a huge focus on error handling and making sure the processes were completed correctly.

            For my OOP class I created a course scheduling application. Using Java, I created a GUI and connected it to a Derby Database.
            Using Prepared Statements and OOP techniques I created functions for sorting, deleting, and adding to the database.

            I was always interested in website development and needed a spot to go more in-depth into my projects. 
            Before taking this on, I had yet to gain experience in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. 
            I used free online sources to get a basic understanding of all three. 
            From this, I plan to start work on a Chrome extension to get more work with these tools, as well as React.
