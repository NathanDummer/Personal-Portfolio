        <h3>
            NextCloud
        </h3>
        <p class = "NextCloud">
            The goal for this project was to create an application for the IT which could automatically create users, delete users, create groups, and create shares for the groups.
            As a result we save roughly $50,000 annually as we were able to use an alternative file sharing service. I used Selenium in Python for all of the automation aspects and logic.
            Flask was used for the dynamic front-end. This project had many pieces and required logging, automatic email generation, secure password generation, and unit testing. Overall, 
            it was a challenging project and I learned a lot.

        <h3>
            <br>JBOD Hardware Simulator
        </h3>
        <p class = "JBOD">
            Developed a software-based JBOD simulator in C to emulate storage device operations including reading, writing, and data retrieval functionality. 
            Implemented makeshift cache functionality and also configured a socket-based communication system. 
            Overall I applied low-level systems programming techniques to handle disk management, data organization, and error handling.
        </p>

        <h3>
            <br>Course Scheduler
        </h3>
        <p class="CourseSchedulerProject">
            For my OOP class I created a course scheduling application. Using Java, I created a GUI and connected it to a Derby Database.
            Using Prepared Statements and OOP techniques I created functions for sorting, deleting, and adding to the database. 
        </p>

        <h3>
            <br>This Website
        </h3>
        <p class="ThisWebsite">
            I was always interested in website development and needed a spot to go more in-depth into my projects. 
            Before taking this on, I had yet to gain experience in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. 
            I used free online sources to get a basic understanding of all three.

            <br>Hello, my name is Nathan Dummer and I am currently a junior at Pennsylvania State University. 
            I am seeking a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in mathematics. 
            I currently work for Astrobotic as a Cyber Security Intern. This was originally for Summer 2024 but was extended indefinitely.
            I created this website as a space to list and go more in-depth on projects as I continue with my studies.
