            I was always interested in website development and I also needed a spot to go more in depth into my projects. I had no prior 
            experience in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. I used free online sources to get a basic understanding for all three. 
            From this I plan to start work on a chrome extension to get more work with these tools as well as React.

            I have always been interested in number theory and Project Euler. In my freetime I sometimes sit down and work 
            on a problem of my choosing. Here is an exampleof my
            solution to Project Eukeler 14. <a href="Project Links/Collatz">Collatz.py</a>

            <br>Hello, my name is Nathan Dummer and I am currently a sophomore at Pennsylvania State University. 
            I am currently seeking a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in mathematics. I created this website 
            to use as a space to list and go more in depth in on projects I take on as I continue with my studies.
